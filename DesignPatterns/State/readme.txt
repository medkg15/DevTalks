The state pattern is helpful for representing a process flow.  It explicitly defines the possible "states" of the process, and the "transitions" between those states.

By explicitly defining states and transitions, it is usually much easier to separate the requirements / intent from the code implementation.  This allows developers and SMEs to better communicate about the intent of the software.

The state pattern can perform checks and operations at each transition, and inspect the current state of the process.  The observer pattern can also be used for external components to observe the process taking place.
